<p>
ARC is now developings it's own hardware and software to control a small autonomous vehicle. We started with an off the shelf RC car and replaced nearly all the electronics in order to create our platform.

The goal of this project is to build a vehicle capable of autonomously exploring and mapping complex environments. In the future, we may use this platform in other challenges or competitions.
