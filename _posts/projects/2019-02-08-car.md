ARC is now developing its own hardware and software to control a small autonomous vehicle. This platform started as an off the shelf RC car, but the electronics have been modified and a suite of sensors and computer hardware have been mounted to a carbon fiber platform mounted to the chassis.

The goal of this project is to build a vehicle capable of autonomously exploring and mapping complex environments. In the future, ARC plans use this platform in other challenges and competitions.
