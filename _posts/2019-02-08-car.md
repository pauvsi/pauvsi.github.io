ARC is now developing its own hardware and software to control a small autonomous vehicle. This platform started as an off the shelf RC car, but ARC has now replaced nearly all the electronics in order to create a robust platform for testing and future projects.

The goal of this project is to build a vehicle capable of autonomously exploring and mapping complex environments. In the future, ARC plans use this platform in other challenges and competitions.
