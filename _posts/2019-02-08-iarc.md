Starting in November of 2015, Purdue ARC began work on a fully autonomous, large scale quadcopter to compete in the International Aerial Robotics Competition: Mission 7. The goal of this challenge was to construct a multirotor capable of herding randombly moving iRobot Roombas  through a designated goal area.

Over the course of three year, the design went through several major prototype and revision phases before being constructed of custom designed and machined carbon fiber plate. It is powered by a massive 22 volt, 10,000 mah LiPo battery, uses four 12" diameter propellors, and contains onboard sensors and computers capable of identifying and locating the iRobot Roombas used in the competition.

Unfortunatley, IARC shut down this competition in 2017 after none of the entrants were able to complete the challenge. At this point ARC moved onto it's current project, the [Autonomous RC Car]({{site.url}}\portfolio\car\)
