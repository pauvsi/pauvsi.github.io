In consideration of recent events with COVID-19, Purdue ARC has decided to host the Fall 2020 callout virtually. Upon release, students will be able to view the callout in an uploaded YouTube video and ask questions in the comment section. In this callout, we will answer general questions, announce changes we are making to fit [Purdue guidlines](https://protect.purdue.edu/), and discuss plans for future. 

This virtual callout won't be released until August 17th, so until then submit any questions you want us to answer on the [contact us page]({{site.url}}/contact/).

See you then!
