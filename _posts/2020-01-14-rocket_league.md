Starting the Fall 2020 semester, ARC has begun building a system of autonomous, scaled vehicles to play head-to-head in a game of soccer. The team took inspiration from the game, Rocket League, in which vehicles play soccer in 3v3 matches.

In the project's first semester, the team created a single working agent capable of planning trajectories and following them to score goals using an overhead camera. The team is now entering it's second semester of the project where they will begin to develop methods for controlling a team of cars. 

Farther into the future, the team hopes to transition the project into a competition played by students at Purdue and other universities. The goal would be to have students develop their own methods for controlling a team of cars, then playing in a tournament-style bracket to find the most optimal approaches.
