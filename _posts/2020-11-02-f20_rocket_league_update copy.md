Purdue ARC made strides today in one of it's latest projects, IRL Rocket League. Through the IRL Rocket League project, Purdue ARC hopes to inspire solutions for autonomous systems through a fast-paced, tournament bracket competition. In the future, students from Purdue and outside universities will compete in developing winning strategies for a game of soccer using fully-autonomous cars.

Though this goal is still far away, the team is hopeful these ideas will come to fruition. This was shown today as the project team had it's first integration test meeting. Students met up in person, following Protect Purdue safety guidelines, to begin bringing the individual components of the system together. As shown in the photo above, a basic field was setup to demonstrate the project's progress. Currently, the team has a working localization system to track the various field elements and an algorithm to plan complex trajectories. In future integration testing, the team will be finely tuning the car's control loops and implementing algorithms to follow the planned paths.

This is one of many steps in achieving the goal set forth by the IRL Rocket League team. By the end of the semester, the team expects to have a fully working autonomous car. One that is able to plan and follow trajectories to score goals with high accuracy. This will then lead to adding additional cars and increasing the overall functionality of the system.

Stay tuned for future updates!
