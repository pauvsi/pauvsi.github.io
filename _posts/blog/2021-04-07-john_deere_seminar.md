## Event Details
Wednesday, April 7th, at 6pm EDT  (view on [calendar]({{site.url}}/calendar))  
[RSVP](shorturl.at/gwBK2>) online (will be emailed meeting link)

## Event Description
The Purdue Autonomous Vehicles Society invites you
to learn about the autonomy and robotics taking place
at John Deere.

This virtual discussion will go in-depth about several
high-tech robotics projects taking place at John Deere
and the behind the scenes details to make them work
in the real world. Afterwards there will be time for
questions from the audience.

This seminar is free and open to the public, but it is primarily aimed at
undergraduate students at Purdue.

## Speakers
**Scott Miller** is a Staff Robotics Engineer and the
Lead Engineer for John Deere’s first embedded deep
learning image processing system. His work
includes embedded ML systems, autonomous
vehicles, and perception system verification. Earning
a BS and MS in Computer Science his previous
research includes work at Oxford University, grant
work with both NASA and the NSF, and research in
Mulitrobot Coordination.

**Sara Wendte** is a robotics engineer contributing to
two of John Deere’s most advanced stereo vision
products. During two internships with John Deere
she also conducted research in the areas of
semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods,
and reinforcement learning for controls applications.
Hailing from Purdue she earned her BS in Electrical
Engineering and her MS in Electrical Computer
Engineering. She was also actively involved with Eta
Kappa Nu (HKN) and Purdue Musical Organizations.
