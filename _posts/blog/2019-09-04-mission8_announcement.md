ARC is beginning work in the fall of 2019 on an autonomous drone system to compete in Mission 8 of the [IARC](http://aerialroboticscompetition.org/).

The goal of the mission is to create a small drone swarm capable of seeking out a QR code key to a locked crate, while also protecting a human operator from enemy drones. The opposing drones will be using a laser tag like system to 'injure' the human operator, and friendly drones will be equipped with a 'healing' laser. Additionally, the human can only interact with the friendly drones through non-electronic means. Gestures and voice commands are OK, but a tablet interface is not.

This mission presents many technical challenges, and it is the goal of the IARC to create advancements in the field through these challenges. Undergraduate and graduate teams will compete in several timed runs, and this competition is expected to last for several years before being accomplished.
