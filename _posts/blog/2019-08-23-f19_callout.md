We've finalized the details of our Fall 2019 Callouts! Everyone interested in robotics or thinking about joining this club is invited to attend.

Here are the details:  
*Callout 1*:  
- **Date**: Wednesday, September 4th  
- **Time**: 6:30 to 7:30 PM  
- **Location**: Armstrong 1103  

*Callout 2*:  
- **Date**: Tuesday, September 10th  
- **Time**: 6:30 to 7:30 PM  
- **Location**: Armstrong 1021

Both callouts will be identical. Simply come to the one that best fits your schedule.

At our callout, we'll go over some of our current and past projects, plans for this upcoming year, and what new members can expect in terms of responsibilities and benefits of joining our club. There is no application process for our club; instead we just ask that you are interested in autonomous robotics and ready to learn. Your experience in ARC will really be what you make it. Additionally, since many of our members graduated last year, there are many opportunities for leadership within the club.

If you are interested, but can't make it to the callout, please fill out the [Contact Us]({{site.url}}/contact/) form or email [James Baxter](mailto:baxter26@purdue.edu)
