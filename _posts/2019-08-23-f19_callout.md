We've finalized the details of our Fall 2019 Callout! Everyone interested in robotics or thinking about joining this club is invited to attend.

Here are the details:  
- **Date**: Wednesday, September 4th  
- **Time**: 6:30 to 7:30 PM  
- **Location**: Armstrong 1103  

At our callout, we'll go over some of our current and past projects, plans for this upcoming year, and what new members can expect in terms of responsibilities and benefits of joining our club. There is no application process for our club; instead we just ask that you are interested in autonomous robotics and ready to learn. Your experience in ARC will really be what you make it. Additionally, since many of our members graduated last year, there are many opportunities for leadership within the club.
