[IARC Mission 8](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/mission8.php) has been accomplished, so ARC will be switching gears to compete in Mission 9 of the [IARC](http://aerialroboticscompetition.org/).

The goal of the mission is to create a UAS capable of traveling 3 km at an altitude under 15 m. Once the traveling portion is complete, the UAS must remove and replace a 2 kg "communication module" on a "Hunter-Kill Vessel" that will be pitching and rolling to simulate open waves. After that task is complete, it will return to the point of launch under the same restrictions. The entire mission must take place within 9 minutes.
