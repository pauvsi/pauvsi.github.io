There are two ways to view our callout this year:

#### Option 1
We have a _synchronous_ option, where you can join us for a live Zoom call, and we'll deliver the presentation real time. This will be just like callouts in the past, except held virtually. This format will allow time for Q&A during and after the presentation. Information is listed on our [Calendar]({{site.url}}/calendar/) and repeated here.

#### Option 2
We also have an _asynchronous_ option, where you can view the callout on YouTube on your own time. This should work well for students who cannot tune into our live callout due to conflicts or differences in time zone. This format doesn't allow for live Q&A, but viewers can ask questions by commenting on the video, [emailing the club](mailto:autonomy@purdue.edu), or submitting questions on the [Contact Us page]({{site.url}}/contact/).
