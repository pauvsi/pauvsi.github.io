It provides hands-on, real world experience to interdisciplinary teams using industry standard tools and practices.
Through ARC, members can meet like-minded individuals, solve real world robotics problems, gain experience with industry-standard tools, and build their career portfolios. We welcome new members of any skill level and provide an environment for members to learn about topics such as state estimation, control algorithms, and machine learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
