Following Purdue's COVID-19 protocol, we expect to have in-person callout events this semester. For students uncomfortable meeting in-person, we will host a live-stream session of the event.

Any student who plans on attending in-person is required to wear a mask.

The dates and times of these callout events are shown below:

**January 19th (Wednesday)**
- Time: 6:00-7:00 PM EST
- Location: ARMS 1109
- [Live-stream link](https://youtu.be/-C5HPcOx_B0)

**January 20th (Thursday)**
- Time: 6:00-7:00 PM EST
- Location: ARMS 1109
- [Live-stream link](https://youtu.be/qGUS2jO9E_g)

Both callout events will contain the same information, so attending both is not required. 

If you are unable to make either dates, then:
1. Learn more about the club on the [about us](https://www.purduearc.com/post/about/) page
2. Visit the [wiki](https://wiki.purduearc.com/) to learn more about our projects
3. Join the [community discord](https://discord.gg/xPJfDaztvS), say hi, and ask any questions that you have
