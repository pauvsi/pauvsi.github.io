Following Purdue's COVID-19 protocol, we expect to have in-person callout events this semester. For students uncomfortable meeting in-person, we will host a live-stream session of the event.

Any student who plans on attending in-person is required to wear a mask.

The dates and times of these callout events are shown below:
- August 31st 6:00-7:00 PM EST

  Location: ARMS B061

  [Live-stream link](https://youtu.be/N37JfZOb-0M)
- September 1st 6:00-7:00 PM EST

  Location: ARMS B061

  Live-stream link: TBD

Both callout events will contain the same information, so attending both is not required. If you are unable to make either dates, reach out in the [community discord](https://discord.gg/xPJfDaztvS).
