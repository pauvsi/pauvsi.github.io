**This article currently acts as a placeholder, check back for updates on the dates/times of the callouts.**

Following Purdue's COVID-19 protocol, we expect to have in-person callout events this semester. For students uncomfortable meeting in-person, we will host a live-stream session of the event.

The expected dates and times of these callout events are shown below:
- August TBD
  Location: TBD
  Live-stream link: TBD

  Location: TBD
  Live-stream link: TBD

If you are unable to make either dates, then:
1. Learn more about the club on the [about us](https://www.purduearc.com/post/about/) page
2. Visit the [wiki](https://wiki.purduearc.com/) to learn more about our projects
3. Join the [community discord](https://discord.gg/xPJfDaztvS), say hi, and ask any questions that you have
