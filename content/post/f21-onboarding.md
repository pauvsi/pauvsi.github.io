Thanks to everyone who attended our callout events this semester. This post is meant to clear any confusion about next steps.

If you haven't already, ensure you have both [joined the Discord](https://discord.gg/WEFEdefSRf) and signed up through [Boilerlink](https://boilerlink.purdue.edu/organization/purduearc). These are essential for staying up-to-date with recent club events.

The following sections will outline next steps depending on your interests.

## Joining an ongoing project
Ongoing projects are ones that have been carried over from previous semesters. The project managers of these projects independently handle the onboarding of new students.

This semester ARC has three ongoing projects:
- Rocket league
- Wizards chess
- Robot arm

Each will host onboarding meetings that are announced in the project's announcement channel in the Discord. If you happen to miss one of these meetings, reach out to the respective project manager in the Discord.

Additionally project's may make an onboarding post on our [blog](https://www.purduearc.com/blog/). So check there for more information.

## Starting a new project
If you are interested in starting your own project within ARC, the first and most important step is to build interest. Connect with other members of ARC and begin building your team.

Projects are accepted through "project pitch sessions", which are announced in the Discord. At these events, students can share their ideas and continue to recruit team members.

In preparation for this process, check out the tutorial we wrote on [project management](https://wiki.purduearc.com/wiki/tutorials/project-management).

## Just hanging out
If you want to stay connected to ARC but don't have the time to commit to a project, that's completely fine.

Just be on the lookout for social events announced in Discord!
