Purdue University's Autonomous Robotics Club seeks to grow its members' knowledge and experience in the field of robotics through creating innovative solutions to the problems faced while creating autonomous robots and systems.

ARC's members come from a diverse set of backgrounds, but all are passionate about robotics and autonomy. Through ARC, members get to meet like-minded individuals, solve real world problems, gain experience with industry-standard tools such as ROS, and build their career portfolios. ARC focuses primarily on the software aspect of robotics, but also develops its own hardware.

ARC welcome new members of any skill level and teaches its members topics such as state estimation, control algorithms, and machine learning. New members have opportunities for leadership early on and can work on the areas of the project that interest them.

Our workshop is housed in Purdue's co-working space, The Anvil. Check out our [portfolio]({{site.url}}/portfolio/) to see our current and past projects and [contact us]({{site.url}}/contact/) with any questions.
