The Autonomous Robotics Club of Purdue was created to grow the skills and abilities of its members through design projects centered around advanced autonomous robotics systems. It provides hands-on, real world experience to interdisciplinary teams using industry standard tools and practices.

Through ARC, members can meet like-minded individuals, solve real world robotics problems, gain experience with industry-standard tools, and build their career portfolios. We welcome new members of any skill level and teach our members topics such as state estimation, control algorithms, and machine learning. New members have opportunities for leadership early on and can gain in depth experience working on the areas of the project they find most interesting. ARC focuses primarily on the software aspect of robotics, but it also develops its own hardware.

The club meets Saturday mornings and Friday evenings in Armstrong Hall, as posted on our [calendar]({{site.url}}/calendar/). Check out our [portfolio]({{site.url}}/portfolio/) to see our current and past projects and [contact us]({{site.url}}/contact/) with any questions.
