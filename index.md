The International Aerial Robotics Competition is the longest running collegiate aerial robotics challenge in the world.
Entering its third decade of advancing the state of the art in autonomous aerial robotic behavior, the competition continues to tackle challenges that are currently impossible for any flying robots owned by government or industry.
